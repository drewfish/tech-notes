STANDARD SHORTCUT -- Derek Arnold (SC rep)
    team
        primary unit of organization
        -> people:  users
        -> work:  milestone, epic, story
        -> process:  workflows, iterations
    workflow
        kanban or sprint
        top level states:  unstarted, started, done
    many:many workflow:team
    story
        smallest unit of work
        (aka jira ticket)
        can have tasks
        can convert a story to an epic (its tasks become stories)
    epic
        collection of stories (suggested about 40)
    milestone
        recommended: time based, or initiative based
    saved spaces
        saved filter view
        only one workflow, suggest using epics to cross workspaces
    iterations
        aka sprints
    labels
        added by anyone
        can be filtered by
    categories
        milestones only
    roadmap
        for timeboxed things
        gantt chart
        can make chnages here
    reporting
        burndown, velocity, etc
        labels have their own burndown charts too
    power bar
        command-space
    status page
        specific to workflow
    api
    roadmap
        planned:  decisions, actionable notifications
        working:  custom fields


EMPLOYER SHORTCUT -- Eli
    "Engineering" workflow
    many teams
    "More Spaces"
    check out quick filter
    org-wide
        swimlanes
            story points
    descriptions take markdown
    sub-tasks can be created to stories
    relationships between stories
    threaded comments
    labels (wild west, alas)
    can move between workflows, but will ask for state update
    epic
        is a collectin of stories
        comments on epics themselves
    milestone
        Picnic is a good example (they do it well)
    roadmap
    iterations
        convention:  {team-name} {number} {name}
        normalized sprint numbers across company
        encouraged:  future sprint
    team page
        most org-related, some not
    projects
        around a theme
        keeps is a good example
    reports
    api
        settings, api tokens
